Fraemi SRT TranslatorThis is a full-stack, AI-powered platform designed to help professional dubbing studios manage and translate SRT subtitle files. The application provides a secure, multi-user environment where studios can manage their projects, with a backend built for scalability and a frontend designed for a seamless user experience.Project OverviewThe Fraemi SRT Translator is architected as a modern web application with a distinct frontend and backend.Backend: A robust REST API built with Flask. It handles all business logic, including user authentication, secure data storage, project management, and integration with third-party AI translation services.Frontend (Planned): A dynamic, single-page application (SPA) built with a modern JavaScript framework like React. It will provide an intuitive user interface for registration, login, project dashboards, and file management.Key FeaturesSecure User Authentication: Users can register and log in to a secure account. Passwords are fully encrypted using Bcrypt.Private Project Dashboards: Persistent login sessions ensure that users can only access and manage their own translation projects.Scalable Architecture: The backend is built using the Application Factory pattern and Blueprints, allowing for easy maintenance and future expansion.AI Integration Ready: The system is designed to seamlessly integrate with Large Language Models (e.g., OpenAI API) for the core translation functionality.Technology StackBackendFramework: FlaskDatabase: SQLite (for development)ORM: Flask-SQLAlchemyAuthentication: Flask-Login, Flask-BcryptFrontend (Planned)Framework: React or Vue.jsStyling: Tailwind CSS or a component library like Material-UI.Backend Setup & InstallationFollow these instructions to get the backend server running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.1. PrerequisitesPython 3.10 or higherpip and venv for package management2. Installation & SetupClone the repository (if applicable)git clone [your-repository-url]
cd Fraemi-SRT-Translator-App
Create and activate a virtual environment for the backend# Create the virtual environment
python3 -m venv backend/venv

# Activate it (on macOS/Linux)
source backend/venv/bin/activate
Install the required dependenciespip install -r requirements.txt
Configure the Flask EnvironmentCreate a file named .flaskenv in the project's root directory and add the following line. This tells Flask where to find your application.FLASK_APP=backend/run.py
Initialize the DatabaseThis command will create the database.db file and all the necessary tables.flask init-db
3. Running the ServerOnce the setup is complete, you can start the Flask development server.python backend/run.py
The API will now be running at http://127.0.0.1:5000.API EndpointsThe backend exposes the following API endpoints. Use an API client like Postman to interact with them.Authentication (/auth)MethodEndpointDescriptionPOST/auth/registerCreates a new user account.POST/auth/loginLogs in a user, starts session.POST/auth/logoutLogs out the current user.Projects (/api)Note: All project endpoints require the user to be logged in.MethodEndpointDescriptionGET/api/projectsFetches a list of all projects for the current user.POST/api/projectsCreates a new project for the current user.Project RoadmapBackend: Integrate with the OpenAI API for the core translation functionality.Backend: Expand the Projects API to handle SRT file uploads and storage.Frontend: Develop the user interface for registration, login, and project dashboards.Full-Stack: Implement subscription and team management features for B2B clients.

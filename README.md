# Fraemi SRT Translator

**Fraemi SRT Translator** is a full-stack, AI-powered platform designed to help professional dubbing studios manage and translate `.srt` subtitle files. The application provides a secure, multi-user environment where studios can manage their projects efficiently. It features a scalable backend and a modern frontend designed for an intuitive user experience.

---

## Project Overview

The Fraemi SRT Translator is architected as a modern web application with a distinct **frontend** and **backend**.

- **Backend:** A robust REST API built with Flask that handles user authentication, secure data storage, project management, and integration with third-party AI translation services.
- **Frontend:** A dynamic Single Page Application (SPA) built with React, offering a seamless interface for registration, login, dashboards, and file management.

---

## Key Features

- **Secure User Authentication**  
  Users can register and log in to secure accounts. Passwords are encrypted using Bcrypt.

- **Private Project Dashboards**  
  Authenticated users have access only to their projects via persistent login sessions.

- **Scalable Architecture**  
  Backend uses Flask's Application Factory pattern and Blueprints for maintainability and scalability.

- **AI Integration Ready**  
  Designed for seamless integration with AI translation services (e.g., Google Generative AI).

## Frontend Setup & Installation

### 1. Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher is recommended)
- `npm` (Node Package Manager), which comes with Node.js

### 2. Installation

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install all the required dependencies
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory to connect with the backend API.

```
# Example for a Vite-based project
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

### 4. Running the App

```bash
# Start the local development server
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at: **http://localhost:5173** (or similar, check the console output).

## Backend Setup & Installation

### 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- `pip` and `venv` for package management

### 2. Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [your-repository-url]
cd Fraemi-SRT-Translator-App

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv backend/venv

# Activate (macOS/Linux)
source backend/venv/bin/activate

# Activate (Windows)
backend\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Flask Environment

Create a `.flaskenv` file in the project root and add:

```
FLASK_APP=backend/run.py
GOOGLE_API_KEY={API_KEY_PLACEHOLDER}
```

### 4. Initialize the Database

```bash
flask init-db
```

This creates `database.db` and all necessary tables.

### 5. Running the Server

```bash
python backend/run.py
```

The API will now be available at:  
**http://127.0.0.1:5000**

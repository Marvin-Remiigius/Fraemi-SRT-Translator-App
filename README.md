# Fraemi SRT Translator

**Fraemi SRT Translator** is a full-stack, AI-powered platform designed to help professional dubbing studios manage and translate `.srt` subtitle files. The application provides a secure, multi-user environment where studios can manage their projects efficiently. It features a scalable backend and a modern frontend designed for an intuitive user experience.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Fraemi SRT Translator is architected as a modern web application with a distinct **frontend** and **backend**.

- **Backend:** A robust REST API built with Flask that handles user authentication, secure data storage, project management, and integration with third-party AI translation services.
- **Frontend (Planned):** A dynamic Single Page Application (SPA) built with React or Vue.js, offering a seamless interface for registration, login, dashboards, and file management.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔐 **Secure User Authentication**  
  Users can register and log in to secure accounts. Passwords are encrypted using Bcrypt.

- 📁 **Private Project Dashboards**  
  Authenticated users have access only to their projects via persistent login sessions.

- ⚙️ **Scalable Architecture**  
  Backend uses Flask's Application Factory pattern and Blueprints for maintainability and scalability.

- 🤖 **AI Integration Ready**  
  Designed for seamless integration with AI translation services (e.g., OpenAI API).
